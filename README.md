# Singularity
is a library on which I recopile every project sent to the Discord server of Dalas, a 'Influencer' whose ultimate goal is to reach elven immortality ðŸ§ª, and for the sake of it, he himself created a place for people to learn programming languages collectively ðŸ‘¥.

Their ultimate goal turns out to be to reach a 'Singularity', an AI who betters itself without any external influences ðŸ’».

The project is at an early stage and you still can join! - May you?: https://discord.gg/dalas âœ¨
