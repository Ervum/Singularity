# Singularity
is a library on which I recopile every project sent to the Discord server of Dalas, a 'Influencer' whose ultimate goal is to reach immortality, and for the sake of it, he himself created a place on where people learn programming (on Python, mainly) and create AIs.

Especifically, their ultimate goal is to reach a 'Singularity', an AI who betters itself without any external influences and make it study celular aging.

Needless to say, the project is at an early stage; may you join?: https://discord.gg/dalas.
