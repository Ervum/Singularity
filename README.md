# 31-Days-Aren't-as-Easy
'31 Days Aren't as Easy" is a novel-like game on which you, a teenager, lefts your parent's home and strives to survive on a abnormally calm world until the 31st of January.
Whereas time elapses, you can choose among (1) buying a pet, (2) going to the park, (3) work, or even (4) staying at home.



On a community on the 'Discord' social network, a challenge between developers arose;
they had to create a game such as 'Tamagotchi', on which you have a pet, whom can be 
(1) assigned a name, (2) has energy and (3) can lose and recover it from whatever way the creator chooses.



This specific one was developed on Python 3, solely by Ervum (or Ervy#0001 on 'Discord').
